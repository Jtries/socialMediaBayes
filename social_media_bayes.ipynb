    "# Time-Stealed, or how social medias are stealing our lives\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Year 2025, a great portion of our lives is experienced within a virtual environment where we can access an infinite stream of information that excites our brain and that pleasures it with rivers of dopamine. The speed, the bright colors, the catchy audios and the enraging news, everything has been carefully engineered to keep us trapped in front of a glowy screen\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Told like this it might sound like the incipit of a cyberpunk novel, but it's actually not that far from our reality, is it? The virtual environments I'm talking about are obviously social medias, that despite all they've done for the free circulation of information, they have a scary dark side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to shed a light on that side and investigate where does our time go and why it seems so difficult to put a stop to a now far too common habbit: doomscrolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why should social medias be implemented to keep us on their platforms? To understand this, it's important to clarify what is their business model. Social medias' profit originates primarely from the \"attention economy\", in other words, they make money by showing tertiary companies' adds to their user base (and by selling their data, but that is a whole other story). So, when the content you're consuming is suddently interrupted by an add, the attention economy has completed its circle: a company made its attempt to convince you to buy their product and the hosting platform made its share. The follow-up question is then, how does the social media of the situation boosts its revenue? Simple, it tries to maximise the exposure time and the engagement of the user. And how does it do it? With a plethora of sophisticated [psychological tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0) that hook the user's attention for [hours](https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/) on end."

Here is a brief descriprion of them:\n",
