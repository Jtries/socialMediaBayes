# socialMediaBayes

The purpose of this project was to show that Bayesian Networks can be an effective tool for extracting relevant information from a domain of interest. Specifically, I wanted to use them to highlight the addictive traits of social media consumption.

I have chosen a (synthetic) dataset containing information about users and their social media usage. Then, I have build different Bayesian Networks to represent the relationships between some selected variables. I have analyzed their structure and, finally, I have queried them with some exact inferences.

I found that all Bayesian Networks, although diversely build, represented the domain of interest with coherence.
