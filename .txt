To build a Bayesian Network, variables are inserted one by one following an ordering. 
At each step, a link between the new variable and the old ones can be added according to a specific criterion. 
For this Bayesian Network, a data-driven approach has been discarded as the selected variables are totally intertwined with eachother. 
Instead,the following logic-driven approach has been applied: 

TODO The prior probability can be computed directly on the data, positive cases / possible cases
